Welcome to the authoritative specification set for the **AI-Native Version Control System (ANVCS)**. This landing page collects the most relevant living documents so you can quickly jump into the spec, review historical addenda, or browse the full archive.

## Start here

- **Core Spec v0.4** – the latest stable specification that supersedes prior drafts. → [Read the spec](./anvcs_core_spec_v_0.4.md)
- **Change Log & Historical Context** – previous versions, research notes, and addenda live in the [archive index](./archive/README.md).

## Feature deep dives

- **Agent Streaming API (v0.2 addendum)** – streaming primitives for real-time interaction. → [View the addendum](./archive/05_anvcs_core_spec_addendum_v0.2_agent_streaming_api.md)
- **Multi-Agent & Live Observability (v0.3 addendum)** – coordination patterns for swarms of agents. → [View the addendum](./archive/06_anvcs_core_spec_addendum_v0.3_multi_agent_extensions_live_observability.md)

## Additional resources

- **Offline & CRDT Shared Memory Research** – supporting research papers and appendices are available throughout the [archive directory](./archive/).
- **Printable versions** – PDF renderings accompany most Markdown documents for distribution in air-gapped environments.

If your tooling expects the legacy `doc/` directory, feel free to mirror or symlink the generated documentation there. All authoritative content now resides under `docs/` for Docusaurus.
