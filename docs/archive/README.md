# ANVCS Docs — Archive

Older or superseded drafts. Keep for provenance.

## Index (add as you archive)
- v0.3 Addendum (Multi-Agent & Live Observability) → [`../addendum-multi-agent-v0.3.md`](../addendum-multi-agent-v0.3.md)
- v0.2 Addendum (Codespaces & Storage Readiness) → [`../addendum-codespaces-v0.2.md`](../addendum-codespaces-v0.2.md)

### Archiving policy
- When promoting a doc to a new version, move the previous version here unchanged.
- Link the new version from `docs/README.md` and the repo `README.md`.
